```

```
**What it means:**

- They keep the pool pure (only from people who paid)

### **Current KLV Pool**

## 💡 Why This Matters

### **Before (Without Separate Counting)**
```
200 Tickets Bought
- 180 paid tickets (100 KLV each) = 15,300 KLV to pool ✅
-  20 free tickets (0 KLV each) = 0 KLV to pool ✅
= 15,300 KLV in pool
BUT CONTRACT SHOWED: 200 total tickets
USER MIGHT THINK: Pool should have 20,000 KLV (200 × 100)?
CONFUSION: Why is pool only 15,300? 😕
```

### **After (With Separate Counting)**
```
Paid Tickets: 180
Free Tickets: 20
Total: 200 tickets

Pool: 15,300 KLV (from 180 paid tickets × 85%)
CLEAR: Free tickets don't contribute
USER UNDERSTANDS: Pool is correct ✅
```

## 💰 Revenue Split Transparency

Users see and understand:

```
When someone buys a ticket for 100 KLV:

├─ 85 KLV goes to Prize Pool
│  └─ This is YOUR entry fee
│     └─ This wins prizes
│
└─ 15 KLV goes to Project Wallet
   └─ This runs the lottery
      └─ This maintains servers
```

**Why transparent?**
- Users want to know where their money goes
